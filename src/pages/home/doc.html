        <h1>Making Augmented Reality applications with JSARToolKit5</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <!-- [image: AR app with 3D object on top of a marker, caption: Augmented Reality brings virtual objects to the real world.] -->

        <p>This article is a short introduction to building augmented reality (AR) web apps with JSARToolKit5. We’re going to
            learn what is JSARToolKit5, what kind of AR apps you can use it for and how you can use it with the Three.js
            3D engine to build 3D AR objects. I’ll also briefly touch on what AR is and why I think it’s going to be awesome.

            <aside>
                <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>

                <p>Augmented Reality is a term used for talking about adding virtual objects to the real world. You may also
                    have heard about Virtual Reality, which is about transporting you to places that are entirely virtual.
                    The two use a lot of the same technologies, but the use cases are different. With AR, you could place
                    virtual IKEA furniture on the floor of your place to see how they'd look like next to your other furniture.
                    With VR, you could teleport yourself into the architectural blueprint of a flat and see how it'd look
                    like when built. AR adds stuff to the real world, VR replaces the real world.

                    <p>What makes me excited about AR is how you can bring virtual objects to the real world. Imagine adding
                        your notes and streams around you on your desk, all updating live. Then walk over to a coffee shop,
                        sit down, and have them all pop up alive there as well. No need to carry around a bunch of tiny screens,
                        make them all virtual.

                        <p>Another use for AR is adding smarts to real-world objects. Light switches that have a line going
                            to the light they control, tree leaves that tell you what kind of tree it is, name tags hovering
                            over people’s heads, navigation arrows appearing on the street, lines in the sky guiding you
                            to meet your friends, translation appearing on top of text that you’re looking at. Adding knowledge
                            and remote controls into the world. By knowing what you’re looking at, you can pull down what
                            is known about it and what you can do with it.
            </aside>

            <p>Briefly, JSARToolKit5 is a JavaScript port of the latest and shiniest version of the ARToolKit augmented reality
                library. You can use JSARToolKit5 to add objects into images and videos and have them look like they’re a
                part of the real-world scene. And not only that, you can also make the virtual objects interactive and animated.

                <p>To demonstrate the kinds of applications you can make with JSARToolKit5, we’re going to write a small AR
                    app that augments the video from your device’s camera. The app is going to place a small box into the
                    video feed and you can tap on the box to open it and have a look at what’s inside.

                    <p>Let’s get started!


                        <h2>Basics of JSARToolKit</h2>


                        <p>JSARToolKit works by tracking special images in your video. These special images are called AR markers
                            and JSARToolKit can figure out where they are in the video and what direction they’re pointing
                            at. By getting the positions and orientations of the AR markers from JSARToolKit, you can draw
                            3D objects on top of the video at the right places to make it look like the objects are a part
                            of the video.

                            <!-- [image: AR Marker, caption: This is the BarcodeMarker we are going to use in our app] -->

                            <p>To load JSARToolKit, include the minified script into your webpage.</p>

                            <pre class="prettyprint"><code>&lt;script src="build/artoolkit.min.js">&lt;/script>
</code></pre>

                            <p>Yes, as you have figured out, we’re going to need three things to build our AR app. We’re going
                                to need an AR marker, a video, and a way to draw 3D graphics on top of the video. For the
                                marker, we’ll use a special built-in marker called a BarcodeMarker. The video we’ll get from
                                your device camera using the getUserMedia API. And we’re going to use Three.js to do the
                                3D graphics. The first thing we’ll do is create the video source. For that, we’ll use the
                                getUserMedia API to get a URL for the device camera and then use that URL as the source for
                                a video element. With this, we have a video element that shows the device camera video feed
                                on it.

                                <p>The simple way to do all this is to use a helper function in JSARToolKit5:
                                    <code class="prettyprint">ARController.getUserMedia(options)</code>. The onSuccess callback in the options object gets called with a ready-to-use video
                                    element. Note that on Chrome for Android, mobile video only plays after interacting with
                                    the page. ARController.getUserMedia adds a window-level touch event listener that plays
                                    the video.

                                    <pre class="prettyprint"><code>var video = ARController.getUserMedia({
	maxARVideoSize: 320, // do AR processing on scaled down video of this size
	facing: "environment",
	onSuccess: function(video) {
		console.log('got video', video);
	}
});
</code></pre>

                                    <p>The first thing we need to do is create an ARController. The ARController keeps track
                                        of the markers we have registered and reads out pixels from the video source. Let's
                                        make one using our new-fangled video element.

                                        <pre class="prettyprint"><code>...

var arController = new ARController(video, 'Data/camera_para.dat');
arController.onload = function() {
	console.log('ARController ready for use', arController);
};

...
</code></pre>

                                        <p>You could also write this by explicitly loading the ARCameraParam (maybe you want
                                            to reuse it):

                                            <pre class="prettyprint"><code>...

var camera = new ARCameraParam('Data/camera_para.dat');
camera.onload = function() {
	var arController = new ARController(video.videoWidth, video.videoHeight, camera);
	console.log('ARController ready for use', arController);
};

...
</code></pre>


                                            <h2>Getting marker positions from JSARToolKit</h2>

                                            <aside>
                                                <h3>AR markers</h3>

                                                <p>Markers are special images used by JSARToolKit to track the 3D positions
                                                    of objects in video and images. You could think of them as hacks to make
                                                    it easy for the software to know what’s going in the image. Instead of
                                                    having to understand the entire image, the software can focus just on
                                                    finding rectangle shapes in the image and comparing the contents of the
                                                    rectangle with registered markers.
                                            </aside>

                                            <p>Now that we have the video hooked up to the manager, we're ready to start tracking
                                                AR markers in the video. Once we see an AR marker, we want to get its details
                                                and find out where it is and which way it is pointing.

                                                <p>Luckily, this ARToolKit takes care of all the math and gives us a nice readily-usable
                                                    transformation matrix. To get the markers in the video.

//
var detectedBarcodeMarkers = {};
arController.addEventListener('getMarker', function(ev) {
	var barcodeId = ev.data.marker.idMatrix;
	if (barcodeId !== -1) {
		console.log("saw a barcode marker with id", barcodeId);

		// Note that you need to copy the values of the transformation matrix,
		// as the event transformation matrix is reused for each marker event

		if (!detectedBarcodeMarkers[barcodeId]) {
			detectedBarcodeMarkers[barcodeId] = {
				visible: true,
				matrix: new Float32Array(16)
			}
		}
		detectedBarcodeMarkers[barcodeId].visible = true;
		detectedBarcodeMarkers[barcodeId].matrix.set(transform);

	}
});

var cameraMatrix = arController.getCameraMatrix();

for (var i in detectedBarcodeMarkers) {
	detectedBarcodeMarkers.visible = false;

                                                    <h2>Using JSARToolKit with Three.js</h2>

                                                    <p>Now that we have the marker positions from JSARToolKit, we can copy them
                                                        to the Three.js objects that should appear on top of the markers.
                                                        Note that if you move the marker outside of the camera, the tracking
                                                        is lost and the Three.js object won't get updated. You can make the
                                                        object either stay where it is, have it abruptly disappear, or fade
                                                        it out. I prefer fading out objects that have lost tracking, but
                                                        it can be a bit fiddly controlling all the opacities of the materials
                                                        in the object.

                                                        <p>The cool thing is that the Three.js object tracking the marker is
                                                            a normal Three.js object. So we can use all the usual tricks
                                                            at our disposal. For this demo, we'll add a touch event handler
                                                            to detect when you're tapping on the object and animating the
                                                            object when you do. The code below is the usual Three.js mouse
                                                            raycasting code, it casts a ray from the mouse coordinates into
                                                            the 3D scene and checks the ray against objects in the scene
                                                            to see if any of them intersect the ray. If we find an intersection
                                                            it means that the intersected object is under the mouse cursor.
                                                            Add the raycasting code in your tap event listener and presto!
                                                            You've got a tappable Three.js scene.

                                                            <p>I added a small animation to the tap listener as well, so that
                                                                when you click on the box object, it opens and stuff flies
                                                                out. To check it out, go visit the demo page and allow access
                                                                to your camera. Now point your camera at a flat piece of
                                                                paper with the marker. Hohoo, you can now see the box. Tap
                                                                on it to open it!

                                                                <p>Code-wise, I'm going to cheat a bit and use the Three.js
                                                                    integration in JSARToolKit5. It does all the stuff that
                                                                    we set up above, and packages it up into a couple of
                                                                    easy-to-use methods. Just load the
